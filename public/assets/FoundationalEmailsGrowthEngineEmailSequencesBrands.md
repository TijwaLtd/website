\- Alt 2: "Shopping smarter: what really matters in cannabis"

\*\*Preview Text:\*\* "We believe in honest education. Here's what you should know..."

\*\*EMAIL BODY:\*\*

Hey {{First\_Name}},

Let's clear up one of the biggest myths in cannabis:

\*\*Indica vs. Sativa labels don't tell the whole story.\*\*

For years, we've all heard it:  
\- Indica \= couch lock, sleep, relaxation  
\- Sativa \= energy, creativity, focus  
\- Hybrid \= somewhere in between

\*\*But here's the truth:\*\* Recent scientific research shows these labels don't reliably predict effects.

\*\*So what actually matters?\*\*

1\. \*\*Cannabinoid profiles\*\* (THC, CBD, CBG levels)  
2\. \*\*Terpene profiles\*\* (the aromatic compounds that drive effects)  
3\. \*\*Your individual body chemistry\*\* (everyone's different\!)

\*\*That's why we use Smokey\*\*, our AI budtender.

Instead of just pointing you to "indica" or "sativa," Smokey asks what \*\*effect\*\* you want, then matches you with products based on chemistry and real customer data.

\*\*Want to see it in action?\*\*

{{First\_Name}},

Quick question: How much time have you wasted scrolling through endless menus, reading confusing descriptions, and still not knowing if a product is right for you?

\*\*Too much. We get it.\*\*

That's why we built something different.

\*\*Our menu is powered by AI that actually understands what you're looking for:\*\*

✅ \*\*Searchable by effect\*\* \- "Help me sleep," "Give me energy," "Reduce anxiety"    
✅ \*\*Real-time inventory\*\* \- Never click on something that's out of stock    
✅ \*\*Lightning fast\*\* \- No more waiting for slow, clunky menus to load    
✅ \*\*Smart recommendations\*\* \- Smokey learns your preferences over time

\*\*Plus, it's all crawlable by Google\*\*, so when you search for cannabis products in \[City\], you'll actually find us (unlike those old-school iframe menus).

\*\*See the difference yourself:\*\*

\[Explore Our Menu →\]

\*\*And if you ever get stuck?\*\*    
Just ask Smokey. It's like having a budtender in your pocket 24/7.
